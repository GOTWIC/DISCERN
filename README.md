## Installation

### Prerequisites

Please make sure to have Conda installed on your system. You can install Miniconda [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/).

This code is meant to run on Windows, with an NVIDIA GPU. Make sure to have the [latest NVIDIA Drivers](https://www.nvidia.com/download/index.aspx). 

While this code uses [DETIC](https://github.com/facebookresearch/Detic) and [DETECTRON](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2), **do not** clone them from the original repositories. They are not supported on Windows and will cause errors. We have included modified versions of both repositories here.

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GOTWIC/DISCERN.git

2. **Install Additional Files**

Download these [additional files](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13yLKYwc9azDdcdX-PfnNfCrQI8Z3Eopl?usp=sharing) and place the folders inside the repository.
